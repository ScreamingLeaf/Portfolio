## Background
Rental bikes serve as the backbone of affordable transportation for densely 
populated urban cities like Seoul, South Korea as they make mobility easier and 
faster. These bikes are very important as they can influence the population to 
lead a healthier lifestyle and a greener one (Nikitas, 2019). In fact, there 
are many countries that have more bikes than cars, to name some would be: 
Denmark, China, and the Netherlands (2011).

The widespread availability of bikes can reduce car emissions (Nikitas, 2019) as
well as it becomes much easier to commute through an urban city. We know that at
2013 there were about 52 countries that have a bike-sharing program (Midgley, 2015),
these bike-sharing programs have had a real impact on the majority of these 
cities as they have also helped reduce traffic congestion along with the healthier
and greener lifestyle (Ngo, 2021) I mentioned before. Seoul is known to be a 
great city to bike through as recently they have built massive cycling infrastructure 
(Jensen, 2019) which helps promote the use of bikes over other types of travel.

A crucial part of providing such an infrastructure involves in maintaining a 
sufficient supply of rental bikes in the city to ensure the availability of the 
service to the public.

One way to predict the required supply would be to identify patterns between
rental bike usage and environmental factors such as weather and time. Not
only will this help us directly infer the rental bike usage, but also assist in
identifying maintenance schedules that cause the least hindrance to people,
which will further improve the service.

This leads us to the question, can we accurately predict the number of rented
bikes for a given time based on the environmental conditions? The goal of this
study is to answer this question and determine how weather and time affect 
Seoul's rental bike usage.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r Libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, results=FALSE}
# Loading the Required Libraries
library(reshape2)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
library(car)
library(onewaytests)
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
```

```{r Loading the Data, include=FALSE}
# Load the csv data
data = read.csv(file = "SeoulBikeData.csv", header=TRUE, check.names = FALSE)
original = read.csv(file = "SeoulBikeData.csv", header=TRUE, check.names = FALSE)
# Modify column names for readability
names(data)[names(data) == "Rented Bike Count"] = "RentedBikeCount"
names(data)[names(data) == "Temperature(\xb0C)"] = "Temperature"
names(data)[names(data) == "Visibility (10m)"] = "Visibility"
names(data)[names(data) == "Rainfall(mm)"] = "Rainfall"
names(data)[names(data) == "Humidity(%)"] = "Humidity"
names(data)[names(data) == "Dew point temperature(\xb0C)"] = "DewPointTemperature"
names(data)[names(data) == "Snowfall (cm)"] = "Snowfall"
names(data)[names(data) == "Wind speed (m/s)"] = "WindSpeed"
names(data)[names(data) == "Solar Radiation (MJ/m2)"] = "SolarRadiation"
names(data)[names(data) == "Functioning Day"] = "FunctioningDay"
```

### Data Size and Validation

After loading the data set and modifying the column names, we first identify
if the data set has missing entries and perform remediation if needed.
```{r Missing Data Check, echo=FALSE}
cat("Missing entries:", sum(is.na.data.frame(data)), ", Number of rows:", nrow(data))
```
### Data Cleaning and Transformation
We can now filter out unwanted data based on how it affects our research question.

1. We can clearly see that the entries in the data for which the bike share is 
non-functional bears no inferential value for predicting bike usage, and can
therefore remove those entries from the data set. Once done, the "Functioning Day"
covariate serves no purpose so we remove the column entirely

```{r Remove non-functional entries, include=FALSE}
sum(is.na.data.frame(data))
data = data[data$FunctioningDay == 'Yes',]
data = data[,!(names(data) %in% "FunctioningDay")]
```

2. Now we identify redundancies in the data by checking the correlation between
the quantitative covariates in the data set. We can see that "Temperature" and
"Dew Point Temperature" have a significant correlation, and of the two, "Temperature"
has a higher correlation with "Rented Bike Count". Therefore, in order to preserve
the independence constraint among covariates, we remove the "Dew Point Temperature"
covariate.

```{r heat Map, echo=FALSE}
# Splitting the covariates into quantitative and non-quantitative
quant_variables = c("RentedBikeCount", "Temperature", "Humidity", "WindSpeed",
                    "Visibility", "DewPointTemperature", "SolarRadiation",
                    "Rainfall", "Snowfall")
non_quant_variables = c("Date", "Hour", "Seasons", "Holiday")
#Creating a Heat Map to Visualize the Relationships Between Quantitative Variables
cormat = round(cor(data[,names(data) %in% quant_variables]),2)
melted_cormat <- melt(cormat)
ggplot(data = melted_cormat, aes(x=Var1, y=Var2, fill=value)) + 
  geom_tile(color="darkgray") + 
  theme(axis.text.x=element_blank()) + 
  scale_fill_gradientn(limits = c(-1,1), colours=c("darkblue","white", "darkred")) + 
  labs(x="",y="",fill="corr")
```

```{r Removing DPT, include=FALSE}
data = data[,!(names(data) %in% "DewPointTemperature")]
```

3. Next, we observe that "Rainfall" and "Snowfall" have quite a low correlation
with "Rented Bike Count". Our primary hypothesis is that this is due to the
large number of entries for which these covariates have a value of 0.

```{r Rain and Snow values, echo=FALSE}
cat("The number of entries with no rainfall:", sum(data$Rainfall == 0))
cat("The number of entries with no snowfall:", sum(data$Snowfall == 0))
```
As predicted, a majority of the entries are like this. We remedy this by converting
both these covariates into booleans, based on whether their values are 0 or not.

```{r Transform rain and snow, include=FALSE}
data$Rainfall = as.integer(data$Rainfall > 0)
data$Snowfall = as.integer(data$Snowfall > 0)
```

To clean the data further, we need to split the "Date" variable into days and months.

```{r Split Date, include=FALSE}
data$Date = as.Date(data$Date, format = "%d/%m/%Y")
data$WeekDay = format(data$Date, "%a")
data$Month = format(data$Date, "%b")
```

4. We now attempt to identify when rental bikes are being used the most. We
hypothesize that they are used mainly for work or school transportation, and bike
usage will peak when work or school begins and ends. 
We visualize the bike usage per hour as a boxplot

```{r Hour vs Bikes boxplot, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = data,mapping = aes(x = as.factor(Hour),y = RentedBikeCount, fill=Hour)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(x="Hour")
```

We can see peaks happening at the 8 and 18 hour marks, which we believe are the 
rush hour times for Seoul (Ryerson, 2018). 

5. We also transform the hours so that they begin in the morning (6 a.m.) rather
than midnight.

```{r Adjusting hours, include=FALSE}
for(i in seq(1:length(data$Hour)))
{
  if(data[i,"Hour"] < 6){
    data[i,"Hour"] = 24 + data[i,"Hour"] - 6
  }
  else
  {
    data[i,"Hour"] = data[i,"Hour"] - 6
  }
}
```

6. Additionally, we predict that the residents of Seoul use bikes to travel to work
and/or school. We can check this by comparing the aggregated number of rented bikes 
for workdays and non-workdays (weekends and holidays).

```{r working vs non-working, echo=FALSE}
cat("Number of bikes rented on a working day:", 
    sum(data[data$WeekDay %in% c("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri") & 
               data$Holiday == "No Holiday",]$RentedBikeCount))
cat("Number of bikes rented on non-working days:",
    sum(data[data$Holiday == "Holiday" | 
               data$WeekDay %in% c("Sat", "Sun"),]$RentedBikeCount))
```
To include this information we can introduce a new boolean value to identify working
days.

```{r add work day, include=FALSE}
data$WorkDay = as.integer(data$WeekDay %in% c("Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri") & 
               data$Holiday == "No Holiday")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(gridExtra)
#Not Work Day
p1 = ggplot(data[data[,"WorkDay"] == 0,],mapping = aes(y=RentedBikeCount,x=Hour))+ 
  geom_col(fill="dodgerblue1") + 
  labs(x="Adjusted Hour", y = "Rented Bikes",title="Rented Bikes on Non Working Days")
#Work Day
p2 = ggplot(data[data[,"WorkDay"] == 1,],mapping = aes(y=RentedBikeCount,x=Hour))+ 
  geom_col(fill="coral1") + 
  labs(x="Adjusted Hour", y = "Rented Bikes",title="Rented Bikes on Working Days")
grid.arrange(p1,p2,nrow=1)
```

7. After observing the graphs, we identified two major points of interest; Rush hour and Working Times. We did some research and discovered the average Seoul resident's work times (Ryerson, 2018) and the rush hour time (Ae, 2021). 

```{r}
#Create Rush Hour
data$RushHour = 0
for(i in seq(1:length(data$WeekDay))){
  if((data[i,"WorkDay"] == 1) & (data[i,"Hour"] %in% c(0,1,2,11,12))){
    data[i,"RushHour"] = 1
  }
}
#Create Working
data$Working = 0
for(i in seq(1:length(data$WeekDay))){
  if((data[i,"WorkDay"] == 1) & (data[i,"Hour"] > 2) & (data[i,"Hour"] < 11))
  {
    data[i,"Working"] = 1
  }
}
```


## Model Generation and Fitting

8. Before investigating possible models, we split the data into a training and a testing data set.

```{r}
set.seed(1005102871)
sample = sample(1:length(data[,1]),size=round(length(data[,1])*0.8,0))
data.train = data[sample,]
data.test = data[-sample,]
```

9. We decided to build our model manually. We started by using hour and hour^2 as our starting model. We chose this because we thought that the overall shape of Rented Bikes would be well explained with a quadratic. This explained the Rental Bike Activity during holidays and weekends well, but fell short during the weekdays.

```{r include=FALSE}
fit1 = lm(RentedBikeCount ~ Hour + I(Hour^2), data.train)
fit1
```

10. Building on top of this model, we used rush hour and working times to better explain the variations that occur during the work days.

```{r include=FALSE}
fit2 = lm(RentedBikeCount ~ Hour + I(Hour^2) + Working + RushHour, data.train)
fit2
```

11. Adding Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall, and Snowfall, the new model could explain the differences in Rental Bike Count that occurred through seasonal and daily weather patterns.

```{r include=FALSE}
fit3 = lm(RentedBikeCount ~ Hour + I(Hour^2) + Working + RushHour + Temperature + I(Temperature^2) + Humidity + Rainfall + Snowfall, data.train)
fit3
```

12. Plotting the residuals for fit3, we noticed that the residuals seem to sloping upwards. To address this, we decided to transform RentedBikeCount using log.

```{r}
fit4 = lm(log(RentedBikeCount) ~ Hour + I(Hour^2) + Working + RushHour + Temperature + I(Temperature^2) + Humidity + Rainfall + Snowfall + Snowfall + WindSpeed, data.train)
summary(fit4)
#Residual Plots
resid3 = resid(fit3)
resid4 = resid(fit4)
p1 = ggplot(data.train) + geom_point(mapping=aes(x=RentedBikeCount,y=resid3,color="coral1"))
p2 = ggplot(data.train) + geom_point(mapping=aes(x=RentedBikeCount,y=resid4,color="dodgerblue1"))
grid.arrange(p1,p2)
```


13. We enhanced our model by factoring in the fact that most people bike during the day.

```{r}
fit5 = lm(log(RentedBikeCount) ~ Hour + I(Hour^2) + Working + RushHour + Temperature + I(Temperature^2) + Humidity + Rainfall + Snowfall + SolarRadiation + Humidity:Rainfall, data.train)
summary(fit5)
```

## Model Validation and Analysis

14. We created a function to evaluate our model.

```{r}
#Model Evaluation Function
evaluate_fit = function(fit){
  resid = residuals(fit)
  #Residual Plot
  plot(data.train$RentedBikeCount,resid)
  
  #QQ Plot
  qqnorm(resid)
  qqline(resid)
  
  #DFFITS
  dffits = dffits(fit)
  plot(dffits, type = 'h')
  
  #Cook's Distance
  cookd = cooks.distance(fit)
  plot(cookd,type='h')
  
  #DFBETAS
  dfbetas = dfbetas(fit)
  plot(dfbetas,type='h')
  
  #Variance Inflation Factor
  vif(fit)
  
}
evaluate_fit(fit5)
```

15. We then validated our model using the test data that we withheld.From the residual plot, it appears that our model works similarly on both the training data and the testing data. Our adjR2 is lower on the testing data compared to the training data, but that was expected.

```{r}
predictions = predict(fit5, data.test)
data.frame( R2 = R2(predictions, data.test$RentedBikeCount),
            RMSE = RMSE(predictions, data.test$RentedBikeCount),
            MAE = MAE(predictions, data.test$RentedBikeCount))
resid.test = log(data.test$RentedBikeCount) - predictions
ggplot(mapping=aes(x=data.test$RentedBikeCount,y=resid.test)) + geom_point() + geom_line(mapping = aes(x= c(0,3600),y=c(0,0),color="coral1")) + labs(y="Residual (Test)",x="Rented Bikes",title="Residuals of Model on Test Data Set") + theme_classic()
```
```
## Conclusion
Model Inferences:
* People like to bike the higher the temperature is, but there is a limit
* People do not like to bike in the rain, though a light drizzle has a much smaller impact than a storm
* People are renting fewer bikes when they are working whereas they are renting more during rush hour
* The more humid it is, the less likely people want to rent bikes
Impact:
The Seoul Bike System can ensure the availability of rental bikes by anticipating rises in demand caused by weather. Hot and dry summers would lead to a rise in demand and with out findings, they can better prepare for this surge.
Limitations:
Our model does not accurate predict bike rentals when they are low. The residuals are also not randomly scattered; Our model does a better job at predicting rental bike usage when the number is high. This is likely due to the fact that we transformed the number of rented bikes using log.
Future Research:
To more accurately maintain the availability of bikes, we would need information on the location of different bike locations. With this information, we would be able to better predict when and where demand for bikes will be high. This would allow the Seoul Bike Sharing System to utilize their existing bikes more efficiently.

```{r}
PayYes = c(24,10,5,16,7,47,45, 57,54,59)
PayNo = c(9,3,4,7,4,12,8,9,10,12)
District = rep(c("NC", "NE", "NW", "SE", "SW"),2)
Race = c(rep("Blacks",5), rep("Whites",5))
data = data.frame(Race, District, PayYes, PayNo)
```

## Part A
We reject the null hypothesis that merit pay increase is independent of race because the confidence interval for the effect of race does not include 1.
We get the likelihood ratio test from difference in deviances between the two models and get a very high p-value so we reject the null hypothesis that merit pay increases are independent of race.
```{r}
fit = glm(PayYes ~ Race + District,data=data)
summary(fit)
z = qnorm(0.975,0,1)
CI_w = 40 + c(-1,1)*z*5.505
CI_w

drop1(fit, test="Chisq")
pchisq(4303-303,1)
